    "summary": "I have been involved in many missions using both legacy and new technologies. I use those experiences to match business needs with technical requirements while following best practices in software development. I like being involved in every part of the development of an application including developing features/tools, setting up processes and best practices (TDD, Code reviews, Pair programming), reducing time to market (CI/CD, Devops principles), etc. As a trainer I'm always keen to share with both about my knowledge and experiences. As a developer I'm eager to learn new things everyday that's why you can meet me in meetups or conferences often as attendee and sometimes as speaker.",
